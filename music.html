    <h2>--- Music ---</h2>
    <p>When I was 13 I discovered <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/">GarageBand</a> on my mother's mac. I started to play around with the different instruments and features and as one can imagine it sounded like an orchestra...<br><br>
    ...An orchestra full of kindergarten kids.<br><br>
    While spending more and more time on trial and error and learning some stuff about the program here and there over the next few months, I quickly realized that the real professionals rather use <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic Pro X</a> than GarageBand, so I quickly switched.<br>
    I then learned about basics of music production over the next few years and started trying to remix songs I liked. While doing so, I learned a lot about how to transform something that you have in your head into something that you can actually hear.</p>
